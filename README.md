# Procedural Animation with Angular 17

Welcome to the **Procedural Animation Project** repository! This project leverages the power of Angular 17 to create procedural animations inspired by natural movements, such as a lizard walking, a snake slithering, and a fish swimming, using constraints and FABRIK (Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics) algorithms.

---

## Project Highlights

### Objective
This project demonstrates how Angular 17 can be used beyond traditional web applications, showcasing its ability to handle creative and interactive animations driven by complex algorithms.

### Key Features
- **Procedural Animations**:
  - Realistic simulations of a lizard's walk, a snake's slither, and a fish's swim.
  - Powered by FABRIK constraints for smooth and natural movements.
- **Physics-Based Constraints**:
  - Implements kinematic constraints to emulate realistic joint and limb movements.
  - Optimized for performance within a web-based environment.
- **Angular Ecosystem**:
  - Standalone components for reusable and modular code.
  - SCSS for organized and dynamic styling.
  - RxJS for responsive data flow and interactivity.

## Technologies Used

### Core Framework
- **Angular 17**: A robust and scalable front-end framework.

### Libraries & Tools
- **FABRIK Algorithm**: For inverse kinematics and realistic animation constraints.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and clean, maintainable code.
- **RxJS**: For managing animation states and event-driven behaviors.
- **SCSS**: For designing visually appealing and adaptable styles.

## How It Works

### Animation Breakdown
1. **Lizard Walk**:
   - Implements limb constraints to replicate a natural walking cycle.
   - Uses FABRIK to calculate joint positions dynamically.

2. **Snake Slither**:
   - Simulates wave-like motion with sinusoidal curves.
   - Constraints ensure smooth transitions and prevent unnatural distortions.

3. **Fish Swim**:
   - Utilizes oscillatory movements to mimic realistic swimming patterns.
   - FABRIK ensures the fish body moves fluidly through water-like paths.

### Why FABRIK?
The Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics algorithm provides an efficient and intuitive method to resolve kinematic chains, ensuring:
- Minimal computational overhead.
- Smooth and continuous motion suitable for real-time rendering.

While working on my Angular 17 project, I came across a fascinating blog post that explores the concept of constraints and their applications in software development:
ðŸ‘‰ Understanding Constraints.

Big thanks to [Johnathon Selstad](https://zalo.github.io/blog/constraints/) for this insightful work that inspired me to think differently about problem-solving. Highly recommend checking it out!"
